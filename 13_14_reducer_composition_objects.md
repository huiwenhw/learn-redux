**13 Reducer Composition with Arrays**
* One reducer can be called by another reducer to update items inside an array 

**Refactoring our current todos function**
* The todos function is hard to understand because it mixes two concerns:
  * How the todo is updated
  * How individual todos are updated 
* Want to extract other functions from it and call them so that every function only addresses a single concern 
* In this case, we decide that creating & updating todo in response to an action is a separate operation and needs to be handled by a separate function called todo 
* For convention, todo should also accept two arguments: current trait and action being dispatched and it should return the next trait 
* In this new function, the state refers to the individual todo 

```Javascript
const todo = (state, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'ADD_TODO':
      return {
        id: action.id, 
        text: action.text,
        completed: false
      };
    case 'TOGGLE_TODO':
      if (state.id !== action.id) {
        return state;
      }

      return {
        ...state, 
        completed: !state.completed
      };
    default:
      return state;
  }
}

const todos = (state = [], action) => {
    switch(action.type) {
      case 'ADD_TODO':
         return [
           ...state, 
           todo(undefined, action)
         ];
      case 'TOGGLE_TODO':
        return state.map(t => todo(t, action));
      default:
        return state;
    }
  };
```

**14 Reducer Composition with Objects: Current state**
* If we create a store with this reducer and log its state, we find that the whole state of the app is an array of todos 
* What happens if we want to store more information? 
* We may want to add a visibility filter such as SHOW_COMPLETED, SHOW_ALL or SHOW_ACTIVE 

**Adding a new reducer**
* To store this new information, we donâ€™t need to change existing reducers
* We will use the reducer composition pattern and create a new reducer that calls the existing reducers to manage parts of its state and combine the results in a single state object 
```Javascript
const visibilityFilter = (
  state = 'SHOW_ALL', 
  action
) => {
  switch(action.type) {
    case 'SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER':
      return action.filter; 
    default:
      return state;
  }
};
```

* First time it runs, will pass undefined as state of the child reducers as inital state of the combined reducer is an empty object {} 
* This gets the child reducers to return their intial states and populates the state object for the first time 
* When an action comes in, it calls the reducers with the pass of the state that they manage and the action and combines the result into the new state object 

* This is another example of the reducer composition pattern 
* This time we use it to combine several reducers into a single reducer that we now use to create our store 
* Initial state of the combined reducer now contains the initial states of the independent reducers. 
* Any time an action comes, the reducers handle the action independently 
```Javascript
const todoApp = (state = {}, action) => {
   return {
     todos: todos(
       state.todos, 
       action
     ),
     visibilityFilter: visibilityFilter(
       state.visibilityFilter, 
       action
     )
   };
};
```

* This pattern helps dev cause diff ppl on the team can work on diff reducers handling the same actions without running into each other and cause merge conflicts 
```Javascript
const { createStore } =  Redux;
const store = createStore(todoApp);
```

* Logging the state after dispatching actions 
```Javascript
console.log('Initial state:');
console.log(store.getState());
console.log('--------------');

console.log('Dispatching ADD_TODO.'); // first todo
store.dispatch({
  type: 'ADD_TODO',
  id: 0,
  text: 'Learn Redux'
});

console.log('Current state:');
console.log(store.getState());
console.log('--------------');

console.log('Dispatching ADD_TODO.'); // second todo
store.dispatch({
  type: 'ADD_TODO',
  id: 1,
  text: 'Go shopping'
});

console.log('Current state:');
console.log(store.getState());
console.log('--------------');

console.log('Dispatching TOGGLE_TODO.'); // toggle first todo
store.dispatch({
  type: 'TOGGLE_TODO',
  id: 0
});

console.log('Current state:');
console.log(store.getState());
console.log('--------------');

console.log('Dispatching SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER');
store.dispatch({
  type: 'SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER',
  filter: 'SHOW_COMPLETED'
});

console.log('Current state:');
console.log(store.getState());
console.log('--------------');

Final state:
[object Object] {
  todos: [[object Object] {
  completed: true,
  id: 0,
  text: "Learn Redux"
}, [object Object] {
  completed: false,
  id: 1,
  text: "Go shopping"
}],
  visibilityFilter: "SHOW_COMPLETED"
}
```
